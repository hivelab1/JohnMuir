Housefly (Musca Domestica),,,"""Saw a common house fly and a grasshopper and a brown bear. The fly and grasshopper paid me a merry visit on the top of the Dome,and I paid a visit to the bear in the middle of a small garden meadow between the Dome and the camp where he was standing alertamong the flowers as if willing to be seen to advantage""","July 21, 1869","Muir, John. 1911.

Mountain Quail (Oreortyx pictus),,,"""The mountain quail (Oreortyx ricta) I often meet in my walks, —a small brown partridge with a very long, slender, ornamental crestworn jauntily like a feather in a boy’s cap, giving it a very marked appearance. This species is considerably larger than the valley quail, socommon on the hot foothills. They seldom alight in trees, but love to wander in flocks of from five or six to twenty through the ceanothusand manzanita thickets and over open, dry meadows and rocks of the ridges where the forest is less dense or wanting, uttering a lowclucking sound to enable them to keep together. When disturbed they rise with a strong birr of wing-beats, and scatter as if explodedto a distance of a quarter of a mile or so. After the danger is past they call one another together with a louder piping note, —Nature’sbeautiful mountain chickens. I have not yet found their nests. The young of this season are already hatched and away, —new broods ofhappy wanderers half as large as their parents. I wonder how they live through the long winters, when the ground is snow-covered tenfeet deep. They must go down towards the lower edge of the forest, like the deer, though I have not heard of them there.""","August 1, 1869","Muir, John. 1911.

Sierra Chipmunk (Tamias Alpinus),,,""" These Sierra chipmunks are more arboreal and squirrel-like. I first noticed them on the lower edge of the coniferousbelt, where the Sabine and yellow pines meet, —exceedingly interesting little fellows, full of odd, funny ways, and without being truesquirrels, have most of their accomplishments without their aggressive quarrelsomeness.

Black-Tailed Deer (Odocoileus Hemionus),,,"""A fine specimen of the blacktailed deer went bounding past camp this morning. A buck with wide spread of antlers, showingadmirable vigor and grace. Wonderful the beauty, strength, and graceful movements of animals in wildernesses, cared for by Natureonly, when our experience with domestic animals would lead us to fear that all the so-called neglected wild beasts would degenerate.""","July 22, 1869","Muir, John. 1911.

Wood Rat (Neotoma),,,"""The chaparral-covered hill-slope to the south of the camp, besides furnishing nesting-places for countless merry birds, is the home andhiding-place of the curious wood rat (Neotoma), a handsome, interesting animal, always attracting attention wherever seen. It is morelike a squirrel than a rat, is much larger, has delicate, thick, soft fur of a bluish slate color, white on the belly; ears large, thin, andtranslucent; eyes soft, full, and liquid; claws slender, sharp as needles; and as his limbs are strong, he can climb about as well as asquirrel.

Douglas Squirrel (Tamiasciurus Douglasii),,,"""I like to watch the squirrels. There are two species here, the large California gray and the Douglas.

Woodchuck (Marmota Monax),,,"""Carlo caught an unfortunate woodchuck when it was running from a grassy spot to its boulder-pile home—one of the hardiest of themountain animals. I tried hard to save him, but in vain. After telling Carlo that he must be careful not to kill anything, I caught sight, forthe first time, of the curious pika, or little chief hare, that cuts large quantities of lupines and other plants and lays them out to dry in thesun for hay, which it stores in underground barns to last through the long, snowy winter""","July 26, 1869","Muir, John. 1911.
