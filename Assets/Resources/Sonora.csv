Tuolumne County Courthouse,"Tuolumne County Courthouse, 41 Yaney Ave, Sonora, CA 95370",Lat: 37.985157 Lon: -120.384217,"Is building, the county courthouse, was built in 1898 on the same site as the original courthouse, built in 1853.

Cady House,"72 N Norlin St Sonora, CA 95370",Lat: 37.985703 Lon: -120.385275,"One-story Greek Revival pre-fabricated home came around Cape Horn in the 1850s.

City Hotel Building (Historic),"145 S Washington St, Sonora, CA",Lat: 37.983515 Lon: -120.381785,"The significance of the City Hotel in Sonora lies in its method of construction and its importance""in the community life of Tuolumne County. In addition, the City Hotel survives today, 130 years after it was built, one of Sonora's oldest buildings and certainly an example of a very early building still standing in California'-s Gold Rush country. It is a rare surviving example of stone building construction dating from the early days of the California Gold Rush. Carefully laid blocks of locally quarried slate and locally made bricks compose the exterior walls of the original portion of this local landmark. These building materials were impervious to fire and explain why the City Hotel survived a disasterous and widespread fire in Sonora in October, 1853.",1852-1896,https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/83001248.pdf,by G.Rogers (Rodge500) - Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sonora_CA.jpg,\Sonora\512px-CityHotel_Sonora.jpg
Sugg House,"37 Theall Street, Sonora, Tuolumne County, CA",Lat: 37.983541 Lon: -120.381580,"This structure represents the beginning of Sonora’s pioneer period, when families began to settle here permanently. In contrast, the miners of the Gold Rush came here expecting to strike it rich but then take their wealth and return home. Sugg House was built by William Sugg, who had come to California as a slave with his master about 1850. In 1854 Sugg purchased his freedom for a dollar. Sugg repaired and refurbished leather harnesses for a living, and although he managed to buy this property with his meager savings, he and his family were never wealthy.",1857-1880's,http://sonoraca.net/ip/displayentityip.php?entitycode=sugghouse --> https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/84001210.pdf,HABS - Public domain,https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ca1180.photos.020229p,\Sonora\SuggHouse_HABS.jpg
Tuolumne County Jail,"175 Yaney Ave, Sonora, CA 95370",Lat: 37.984134 Lon: -120.386118,"The history of law and order during the Gold Rush mirrored the social, cultural, economic, and political turbulence of the time. Hoodlums seeking their share of the gold and covered by the cloak of anonymity made targets of travelers and miners. The absence of social controls and “hometown morality” led the predominantly male society to activities such as gambling, drinking, and prostitution, which often resulted in staggering law enforcement problems. During the year 1850, at least 30 murders (twelve during one week) took place in the county, which then reported only 8,351 people.",1857 - 1961,https://npgallery.nps.gov/pdfhost/docs/NRHP/Text/78000822.pdf --> https://tchistory.org/TCHISTORY/Jail.htm,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license, author: Bobak Ha'Eri",https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2009-0724-CA-TuolumneCtyJail.jpg,\Sonora\512px_TuolumneCtyJail.jpg
