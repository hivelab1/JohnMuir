Hornitos Masonic Hall,2877 Bear Valley Road ,La: 37.5011726 Lo: -120.23837,“The Hornitos Masonic Hall building was listed under Criterion A at the local level of significance in the area of social history for the importance of the building as a lodge hall during the years 1873-1930. The building began life as a store but was purchased in 1873 by the Masons for Lodge Hall No. 98. It played a critical role in social life of its memebers. The building continues today as a lodge hall but the period of significance ends in 1930 when the fraternal organization played less of a role in the daily lives of its members.”,Significant year 1873-1930 ,,HABS - Public domain,"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Masonic_Hall_(Hornitos,_CA).jpg",\Hornitos\Masonic_Hall_Hornitos_HABS.jpg
