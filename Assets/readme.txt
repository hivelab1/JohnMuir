Welcome to the John Muir app framework! This document serves as a brief guide on how to implement it.

The basics are as follows:
	You run the app -> The app crawls ManifestURI for a manifest.json -> The app crawls all URIs in manifest.json ->
	The app converts all JSON objects to Data Objects -> The app auto-populates all fields by itself.

As a result, the only real thing you need to do is what is outlined in Assets/JSON/readme.txt. Go there, and have a look.
