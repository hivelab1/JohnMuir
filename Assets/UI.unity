      description: This morning a few hours after setting out with the crawling sheep-cloud,
        we gained the summit of the first well-defined bench on the mountain-flank
        at Pino Blanco. The Sabine pines interest me greatly. They are so airy and
        strangely palm-like I was eager to sketch them, and was in a fever of excitement
        without accomplishing much. I managed to halt long enough, however, to make
        a tolerably fair sketch of Pino Blanco peak from the southwest side, where
        there is a small field and vineyard irrigated by a stream that makes a pretty
        fall on its way down a gorge by the roadside.After gaining the open summit
        of this first bench, feeling the natural exhilaration due to the slight elevation
        of a thousand feet or so, and the hopes excited concerning the outlook to
        be obtained, a magnificent section of the Merced Valley at what is called
        Horse shoe Bend came full in sight, --a glorious wilderness that seemed to
        be calling with a thousand songful voices.""  "

      description: We are now on what may be called the second bench or plateau of
        the Range, after making many small ups and downs over belts of hill-waves,
        with, of course, corresponding changes in the vegetation. In open spots many
        of the lowland composit are still to be found, and some of the Mariposa tulips
        and other conspicuous members of the lily family; but the characteristic blue
        oak of the foothills is left below, and its place is taken by a fine large
        species (Quercus Californica) with deeply lobed deciduous leaves, picturesquely
        divided trunk, and broad, massy, finely lobed and modeled head. Here also
        at a height of about twenty-five hundred feet we come to the edge of the great
        coniferous forest, made up mostly of yellow pine with just a few sugar pines.
        We are now in the mountains and they are in us, kindling enthusiasm, making
        every nerve quiver, filling every pore and cell of us. Our flesh-and-bone
        tabernacle seems transparent as glass to the beauty about us, as if truly
        an inseparable part of it, thrilling with the air and trees, streams and rocks,
        in the waves of the sun, --a part of all nature, neither old nor young, sick
        nor well, but immortal. Just now I can hardly conceive of any bodily condition
        dependent on food or breath any more than the ground or the sky."""

        was anxiously brooding on the breadproblem, so troublesome to wanderers, and
        trying to believe that I might learn to live like the wild animals, gleaning
        nourishment hereand there from seeds, berries, etc., sauntering and climbing
        in joyful independence of money or baggage, Mr. Delaney, a sheep-owner,for
        whom I had worked a few weeks, called on me, and offered to engage me to go
        with his shepherd and flock to the headwaters of the Merced and Tuolumne rivers,
        the very region I had most in mind. I was in the mood to accept work of any
        kind that would take meinto the mountains whose treasures I had tasted last
        summer in the Yosemite region. The flock, he explained, would be moved gradually
        higher through the successive forest belts as the snow melted, stopping for
        a few weeks at the best places we came to\"\"As John Muir begins his trip
        he describes all of his travel campanions. During this trip, Muir provides
        an insight of Yosemite and his personal experiences as a hereder. June 3,
        1869:  \"\"Mr. Delaney, bony and tall, with sharply hacked profile like Don
        Quixote, leading the pack-horses, Billy, the proud shepherd, a Chinaman and
        a Digger Indian to assist in driving for the first few days in thebrushy foothills,

        Chinamanseemed to think we were lost, and chattered in pidgin English concerning
        the abundance of \"\"litty stick\"\" (chaparral), while the Indiansilently
        scanned the billowy ridges and gulches for openings. Pushing through the thorny
        jungle, we at length discovered a road trending toward Coulterville, which
        we followed until an hour before sunset, when we reached a dry ranch and camped
        for the night.\"\"    June 4, 1869                               \"\"Billy
        and the Indian and the Chinaman kept them headed along the weary road,and
        allowed them to pick up what little they could find on a breadth of about
        a quarter of a mile. But as several flocks had already goneahead of us, scarce
        a leaf, green or dry, was left; therefore the starving flock had to be hurried
        on over the bare, hot hills to the nearest of the green pastures, about twenty

        bewteen the local "Miwoks" and the "Paiute" people. The Mono Lake Paiute people
        began moving West from the Eastern Sierras at the end of the 1800''s and beginning
        of the 19th c. which created tribal rivalries. Muir''s tone when speaking
        about the Miwoks certainly reflects the more ethnocentric views of his time,
        however it does provide historical insight that is constantly reinterpreted
        with new evidence.  June 7, 1869:""Brown had left his mountain home ere we
        arrived, but a considerable number of Digger Indians still linger in their
        cedar-bark huts on the edge of the flat. They were attracted in the first
        place by the white hunter whom they had learned to respect, and to whom they
        looked for guidance and protection against their enemies the Pah Utes, who
        sometimes made raids across from the east side of the Range to plunder the
        stores of the comparatively feeble Diggers and steal their wives." The name
        "Digger Indians" is now widely considered an offensive slur, and some modern
        descedents prefer to be called by the name of their individual band/tribe
        as opposed to "Miwok People" or "Yokuts People".'

        in hunting bears much like ""Carlos"" the saint benard that helps Muir.June
        7th, 1869""Here the adventurous pioneer David Brown made his headquarters
        for many years, dividing his time between gold-hunting and bear-hunting. Where
        could lonely hunter find a better solitude? Game in the woods, gold in the
        rocks, health and exhilaration in the air, while the colors and cloud furniture
        of the sky are ever inspiring through all sorts of weather. Though sternly
        practical, like most pioneers, old David seems to have been uncommonly fond
        of scenery. Mr. Delaney, who knew him well, tells me that he dearly loved
        to climb to the summit of a commanding ridge to gaze abroad over the forest
        to the snow-clad peaks andsources of the rivers, and over the foreground valleys
        and gulches to note where miners were at work or claims were abandoned, judging
        by smoke from cabins and camp-fires, the sounds of axes, etc.; and when a
        rifle-shot was heard, to guess who was the hunter, whether Indian or some
        poacher on his wide domain. His dog Sandy accompanied him everywhere, and
        well the little hairy mountaineer knew and loved his master and his master''s
        aims. In deer-hunting he had but little to do, trotting behind his master
        as he slowly made his way through the wood, careful not to step heavily on
        dry twigs, scanning open spots in the chaparral, where the game loves to feed
        in the early morning and towards sunset; peering cautiously over ridges as
        new outlooks were reached, and along the meadowy bordersof streams. But when
        bears were hunted, little Sandy became more important, and it was as a bear-hunter
        that Brown became famous."" "'

        from the north end of the Range to the extreme south. Many other caves occur
        on the belt, but none like this, as far as I have learned, combiningas it
        does sunny outdoor brightness and vegetation with the crystalline beauty of
        the under-world. It is claimed by a Frenchman, who has fenced and locked it,
        placed a boat on the lakelet and seats on the mossy bank under the maple trees,
        and charges a dollar admission fee. Being on one of the ways to the Yosemite
        Valley, a good many tourists visit it during the travel months of summer,

        the sides to ordinary high-water mark. When I climbed on top of it to-day
        and lay down to rest, it seemed the most romantic spot I had yet found, --the
        one big stone with its mossy level top and smooth sides standing square and
        firm and solitary, like an altar, the fall in front of it bathing it lightly
        with the finest of the spray, just enough to keep its moss cover fresh; the
        clear green pool beneath, with its foam-bells and its half circle of lilies
        leaning forward like a band of admirers, and flowering dogwood and alder trees
        leaning over all in sun-sifted arches. How soothingly, restfully cool it is
        beneath that leafy, translucent ceiling, and how delightful the water music--the
        deep bass tones of the fall, the clashing, ringing spray, and infinite variety
        of small low tones of the current gliding past the side of the boulder-island,
        and glinting against a thousand smaller stones down the ferny channel! All
        this shut in; every one of these influences acting at short range as if in
        a quiet room. The place seemed holy, where one might hope to see God.After
        dark, when the camp was at rest, I groped my way back to the altar boulder
        and passed the night on it, --above the water, beneath the leaves and stars,
        --everything still more impressive than by day, the fall seen dimly white,
        singing Nature''s old love song with solemn enthusiasm, while the stars peering
        through the leaf-roof seemed to join in the white water''s song. Precious
        night, precious day to abide in me forever. Thanks be to God for this immortal
        gift."""'

        us with information of Native Americans.On June 16, 1869 Muir decribes how
        the Native American''s manage to live without disturbing nature and going
        unnoticed.""One of the Indians from Brown''s flat got right into the middle
        of the camp this morning, unobserved. I was seated on a stone, looking over
        my notes and sketches, and happening to look up, was startled to see him standing
        grim and silent within a few steps of me, as motionless and weather-stained
        as an old tree stump that had stood their for centuries.All Indians seem to
        have learned this wonderful way of walking unseen,--making themselves invisible
        like certain spiders I have been observing here, which, in case of alarm,
        caused, for example, by a bird alighting on the bush their webs are spread
        upon, immediately bounce themselves up and down on their elastic threads so
        rapidly that only a blur is visible. The wild Indian power of escaping observation,
        even where there is little or no cover to hide in, was probably slowly acquired
        in hard hinting and fighting lessons while trying to approach game, take enemies
        by surprise, or get safely away when compelled to retreat. And this experience
        transmitted through many generations seems at length to have become what is
        vaguely called instinct""""Along the main ridges and larger branches of the
        river Indian trails may be traced, but they are not nearly as distinct as
        one would expect to find them. How many centuries Indians have roamed these
        woods nobody knows, probably a great many, extending far beyond the time that
        Columbus touched our shores, and it seems strange that heavier marks have
        not been made. Indians walk softly and hurt the landscape hardly more than
        the birds and squirrels, and their brush and bark huts last hardly longer
        than those of wood rats, while their more enduring monuments, excepting those
        wrought on the forests by the fires they made to improve their hunting grounds,
        vanish in a few centuries."""'

        is somewhat demoralized, and seems to care but little what becomes of his
        flock. He says that since the boss has failed to feed him he is not rightly
        bound to feed the sheep, and swears that no decent white man can climb these
        steep mountains on mutton alone. ""It''s not fittin'' grub for a white man
        really white. For dogs and coyotes and Indians it''s different. Good grub,
        good sheep. That''s what I say."" Such was Billy''s Fourth of July oration""July
        6th, 1869""The trappers and fur traders of early days in the Rocky Mountain
        regions lived on bison and beaver meat for months. Salmon-eaters, too, there
        are among both Indians and whites who seem to suffer little or not at all
        from the want of bread. Just at this moment mutton seems the least desirable
        of food, though of good quality. We pick out the leanest bits, and down they
        go against heavy disgust, causing nausea and an effort to reject the offensive
        stuff. Tea makes matters worse, if possible. The stomach begins to assert
        itself as an independent creature with a will of its own. We should boil lupine
        leaves, clover, starchy petioles, and saxifrage rootstocks like the Indians.""July
        7th, 1869""We dream of bread, a sure sign we need it. Like the Indians, we
        ought to know how to get the starch out of fern and saxifrage stalks, lily
        bulbs, pine bark,etc. Our education has been sadly neglected for many generations.
        Wild rice would be good. I noticed a leersia in wet meadow edges, but the
        seeds are small. Acorns are not ripe, nor pine nuts, nor filberts. The inner
        bark of pine or spruce might be tried. Drank tea until half intoxicated. Man
        seems to crave a stimulant when anything extraordinary is going on, and this
        is the only one I use. Billy chews great quantities of tobacco, which I suppose
        helps to stupefy and moderate his misery. We look and listen for the Don every
        hour. How beautiful upon the mountains his big feet would be!""July 8th, 1869""Indians
        and bears and birds and fat grubs feast on the berries, which look like small
        apples, often rosy on one side, green on the other. The Indians are said to
        make a kind of beer or cider out of them."""'

        Snow that refused to melt in fire would hardly be more wonderful than unchanging
        dullness in the rays of God's beauty. I have been trying to get him to walk
        to the brink of Yosemite for a view, offering to watch the sheep for a day,
        while he should enjoy what tourists come from all over the world to see. But
        though within a mile of the famous valley, he will not go to it even out of
        mere curiosity. \"\"What,\"\" says he, \"\"is Yosemite but a ca\uFFFDon\uFFFDa

        day, falling half a mile through the air\uFFFDthink of that, and the sound
        it makes. You can hear it now like the roar of the sea.\"\" Thus I pressed
        Yosemite upon him like a missionary offering the gospel, but he would have
        none of it. \"\"I should be afraid to look over so high a wall,\"\" he said.
        \"\"It would make my head swim. There is nothing worth seeing anyway, only
        rocks, and I see plenty of them here. Tourists that spend their money to see
        rocks and falls are fools, that's all. You can't humbug me. I've been in this
        country too long for that.\"\" Such souls, I suppose, are asleep, or smothered
        and befogged beneath mean pleasures and cares.\"\"\""

        rock faces among the basin and said: \"\"The lake was named for one of the
        chiefs of the Yosemite tribe. Old Tenaya is said to have been a good Indian
        to his tribe. When a company of soldiers followed his band into Yosemite to
        punish them for cattle-stealing and other crimes, they fled to this lake by
        a trail that leads out of the upper end of the valley, early in the spring,
        while the snow was still deep; but being pursued, they lost heart and surrendered.
        A fine monument the old man has in this bright lake, and likely to last a
        long time, though lakes die as well as Indians, being gradually filled with
        detritus carried in by the feeding streams, and to some extent also by snow
        avalanches and rain and wind. A considerable portion of the Tenaya basin is
        already changed into a forested flat and meadow at the upper end, where the
        main tributary enters from Cathedral Peak. Two other tributaries come from
        the Hoffman Range. The outlet flows westward through Tenaya Ca\uFFFDon to
        join the Merced River in Yosemite. Scarce a handful of loose soil is to be
        seen on the north shore. All is bare, shining granite, suggesting the Indian
        name of the lake, Pywiack, meaning shining rock.\"\" In fact, the lake was
        being called Py-we-ack, or place of shining rocks, long before it was called
        Tenaya Lake. The name was only changed after the Mariposa Battallion of militia
        men came and conquered Chief Tenaya's band, renaming the lake after their
        morally questionable victory. \""

        August 2, 1869:\"\"Had some one whispered in my ear while I sat on the Dome,
        where I had spent so many days, that Professor Butler was in the valley, I
        could not have been more surprised and startled. When I was leaving the university
        he said, \"\"Now, John, I want to hold you in sight and watch your career.
        Promise to write me at least once a year.\"\" I received a letter from him
        in July, at our first camp in the Hollow, written in May, in which he said
        that he might possibly visit California some time this summer, and therefore
        hoped to meet me. But in as much as he named no meeting-place, and gave no
        directions as to the course he would probably follow, and as I should be in
        the wilderness all summer, I had not the slightest hope of seeing him, and
        all thought of the matter had vanished from my mind until this afternoon,
        when he seemed to be wafted bodily almost against my face. Well, to-morrow
        I shall see; for, reasonable or unreasonable, I feel I must go.\"\"August
        3, 1869:\"\"\uFFFDHad a wonderful day. Found Professor Butler as the compass-needle
        finds the pole. So last evening's telepathy, transcendental revelation, or
        whatever else it may be called, was true; for, strange to say, he had just
        entered the valley by way of the Coulterville Trail and was coming up the
        valley past El Capitan when his presence struck me. Had he then looked toward
        the North Dome with a good glass when it first came in sight, he might have
        seen me jump up from my work and run toward him. This seems the one well-defined
        marvel of my life of the kind called supernatural; for, absorbed in glad Nature,
        spirit-rappings, second sight, ghoststories, etc., have never interested me
        since boyhood, seeming comparatively useless and infinitely less wonderful
        than Nature's open, harmonious, songful, sunny, every-day beauty.\"\"\"\"Emerging
        from the ca\uFFFDon shadows, I found a man making hay on one of the meadows,
        and asked him whether Professor Butler was in the valley. \"\"I don't know,\"\"
        he replied; \"\"but you can easily find out at the hotel. There are but few
        visitors in the valley just now. A small party came in yesterday afternoon,
        and I heard some one called Professor Butler, or Butterfield, or some name

      description: "\"Muir finds his former professor who he is in constant touch
        with before the professor leaves Yosemite Valley.August 3, 1869: \"\"In less
        than an hour I reached the head of the Nevada Ca\uFFFDon at the Vernal Fall,
        and just outside of the spray discovered a distinguished-looking gentleman,
        who, like everybody else I have seen to-day, regarded me curiously as I approached.
        When I made bold to inquire if he knew where Professor Butler was, he seemed
        yet more curious to know what could possibly have happened that required a
        messenger for the Professor, and instead of answering my question he asked
        with military sharpness, \"\"Who wants him?\"\" \"\"I want him,\"\" I replied
        with equal sharpness. \"\"Why? Do you know him?\"\" \"\"Yes,\"\" I said. \"\"Do
        you know him?\"\"Astonished that any one in the mountains could possibly know
        Professor Butler and find him as soon as he had reached the valley, he came
        down to meet the strange mountaineer on equal terms, and courteously replied,
        \"\"Yes, I know Professor Butler very well. I am General Alvord, and we were
        fellow students in Rutland, Vermont, long ago, when we were both young.\"\"
        \"\"But where is he now?\"\"I persisted, cutting short his story. \"\"He has
        gone beyond the falls with a companion, to try to climb that big rock, the
        top of which you see from here.\"\" His guide now volunteered the information
        that it was the Liberty Cap Professor Butler and his companion had gone to
        climb, and that if I waited at the head of the fall I should be sure to find
        them on their way down. I therefore climbed the ladders alongside the Vernal
        Fall, and was pushing forward, determined to go to the top of Liberty Cap
        rock in my hurry, rather than wait, if I should not meet my friend sooner.
        So heart-hungry at times may one be to see a friend in the flesh, however
        happily full and care-free one's life may be. I had gone but a short distance,
        however, above the brow of the Vernal Fall when I caught sight of him in the
        brush and rocks, half erect, groping his way, his sleeves rolled up, vest
        open, hat in his hand, evidently very hot and tired.When he saw me coming
        he sat down on a boulder to wipe the perspiration from his brow and neck,
        and taking me for one of the valley guides, he inquired the way to the fall
        ladders. I pointed out the path marked with little piles of stones, on seeing
        which he called his companion, saying that the way was found; but he did not
        yet recognize me. Then I stood directly in front of him, looked him in the
        face, and held out my hand. He thought I was offering to assist him in rising.\"\"Never
        mind,\"\" he said. Then I said, \"\"Professor Butler, don't you know me?\"\"
        \"\"I think not,\"\" he replied; but catching my eye, sudden recognition followed,
        and astonishment that I should have found him just when he was lost in the
        brush and did not know that I was within hundreds of miles of him. \"\"John
        Muir, John Muir, where have you come from?\"\" Then I told him the story of
        my feeling his presence when he entered the valley last evening, when he was
        four or five miles distant, as I sat sketching on the North Dome. This, of
        course, only made him wonder the more.Below the foot of the Vernal Fall the
        guide was waiting with his saddle-horse, and I walked along the trail, chatting
        all the way back to the hotel, talking of school days, friends in Madison,
        of the students, how each had prospered, etc., ever and anon gazing at the
        stupendous rocks about us, now growing indistinct in the gloaming, and again
        quoting from the poets, \uFFFDa rare ramble. It was late ere we reached the
        hotel, and General Alvord was waiting the Professor's arrival for dinner.
        When I was introduced he seemed yet more astonished than the Professor at
        my descent from cloudland and going straight to my friend without knowing
        in any ordinary way that he was even in California. They had come on direct
        from the East, had not yet visited any of their friends in the state, and
        considered themselves undiscoverable. As we sat at dinner, the General leaned
        back in his chair, and looking down the table, thus introduced me to the dozen
        guests or so, including the staring fisherman mentioned above: \"\"This man,
        you know, came down out of these huge, trackless mountains, you know, to find
        his friend Professor Butler here, the very day he arrived; and how did he
        know he was here? He just felt him, he says. This is the queerest case of
        Scotch farsightedness I ever heard of,\"\" etc., etc. While my friend quoted
        Shakespeare: \"\"More things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt
        of in your philosophy,\"\" \"\"As the sun, ere he has risen, sometimes paints
        his image in the firmament, e'en so the shadows of events precede the events,
        and in to-day already walks to-morrow.\"\"Had a long conversation, after dinner,
        over Madison days. The Professor wants me to promise to go with him, sometime,
        on a camping trip in the Hawaiian Islands, while I tried to get him to go
        back with me to camp in the high Sierra. But he says, \"\"Not now.\"\" He
        must not leave the General; and I was surprised to learn they are to leave
        the valley to-morrow or next day. I'm glad I'm not great enough to be missed
        in the busy world.\"\"August 4, 1869:\"\"\uFFFDIt seemed strange to sleep
        in a paltry hotel chamber after the spacious magnificence and luxury of the
        starry sky and silver fir grove. Bade farewell to my friend and the General.
        The old soldier was very kind, and an interesting talker. He told me long
        stories of the Florida Seminole war, in which he took part, and invited me
        to visit him in Omaha. Calling Carlo, I scrambled home through theIndian Ca\uFFFDon
        gate, rejoicing, pitying the poor Professor and General, bound by clocks,
        almanacs, orders, duties, etc., and compelled to dwell with lowland care and
        dust and din, where Nature is covered and her voice smothered, while the poor,
        insignificant wanderer enjoys the freedom and glory of God's wilderness.\"\"
        \  \"\"Before parting with Professor Butler he gave me a book, and I gave
        him one of my pencil sketches for his little son Henry, who is a favorite
        of mine. He used to make many visits to my room when I was a student. Never
        shall I forget his patriotic speeches for the Union, mounted on a tall stool,
        when he was only six years old.\"\"\""

        I like.\"\"August 13, 1869:\"\"Mr. Delaney arrived with two shepherds, one
        of them an Indian. On his way up from the plains he left some provisions at
        the Portuguese camp on Porcupine Creek near our old Yosemite camp, and I set
        out this morning with one of the pack animals to fetch them. Arrived at the
        Porcupine camp at noon, and might have returned to the Tuolumne late in the
        evening, but concluded to stay over night with the Portuguese shepherds at
        their pressing invitation. They had sad stories to tell of losses from the
        Yosemite bears, and were so discouraged they seemed on the point of leaving
        the mountains; for the bears came every night and helped themselves to one
        or several of the flock in spite of all their efforts to keep them off.\"\"\"\"On
        my return after sunset to the Portuguese camp I found the shepherds greatly
        excited over the behavior of the bears that have learned to like mutton. \"\"They
        are getting worse and worse,\"\" they lamented. Not willing to wait decently
        until after dark for their suppers, they come and kill and eat their fill
        in broad daylight. The evening before my arrival, when the two shepherds were
        leisurely driving the flock toward camp half an hour before sunset, a hungry
        bear came out of the chaparral within a few yards of them and shuffled deliberately
        toward the flock. \"\"Portuguese Joe,\"\" who always carried a gun loaded
        with buckshot, fired excitedly, threw down his gun, fled to the nearest suitable
        tree, and climbed to a safe height without waiting to see the effect of his
        shot. His companion also ran, but said that he saw the bear rise on its hind
        legs and throw out its arms as if feeling for somebody, and then go into the
        brush as if wounded.\"\"\"\"At another of their camps in this neighborhood,
        a bear with two cubs attacked the flock before sunset, just as they were approaching
        the corral. Joe promptly climbed a tree out of danger, while Antone, rebuking
        his companion for cowardice in abandoning his charge, said that he was not
        going to let bears \"\"eat up his sheeps\"\" in daylight, and rushed towards
        the bears, shouting and setting his dog on them. The frightened cubs climbed
        a tree, but the mother ran to meet the shepherd and seemed anxious to fight.
        Antone stood astonished for a moment, eyeing the oncoming bear, then turned
        and fled, closely pursued. Unable to reach a suitable tree for climbing, he
        ran to the camp and scrambled up to the roof of the little cabin; the bear
        followed, but did not climb to the roof, \uFFFDonly stood glaring up at him
        for a few minutes, threatening him and holding him in mortal terror, then
        went to her cubs, called them down, went to the flock, caught a sheep for
        supper, and vanished in the brush. As soon as the bear left the cabin the
        trembling Antone begged Joe to show him a good safe tree, up which he climbed
        like a sailor climbing a mast, and remained as long as he could hold on, the
        tree being almost branchless.After these disastrous experiences the two shepherds
        chopped and gathered large piles of dry wood and made a ring of fire around
        the corral every night, while one with a gun kept watch from a comfortable
        stage built on a neighboring pine that commanded a view of the corral. This
        evening the show made by the circle of fire was very fine, bringing out the
        surrounding trees in most impressive relief, and making the thousands of sheep
        eyes glow like a glorious bed of diamonds\"\"August 14, 1869:\"\"\uFFFDUp
        to the time I went to bed last night all was quiet, though we expected the
        shaggy freebooters every minute. They did not come till near midnight, when
        a pair walked boldly to the corral between two of the great fires, climbed
        in, killed two sheep and smothered ten, while the frightened watcher in the
        tree did not fire a single shot, saying that he was afraid he might kill some
        of thesheep, for the bears got into the corral before he got a good clear
        view of them. I told the shepherds they should at once move the flock to another
        camp. \"\"Oh, no use, no use,\"\" they lamented; \"\"where we go, the bears
        go too. See my poor dead sheeps, \uFFFDsoon all dead. No use try another camp.
        We go down to the plains.\"\" And as I afterwards learned, they were driven
        out of the mountains a month before the usual time. Were bears much more numerous
        and destructive, the sheep would be kept away altogether.\"\"August 21, 1869:\"\"Have
        just returned from a fine wild excursion across the range to Mono Lake, by
        way of the Mono or Bloody Ca\uFFFDon Pass. Mr. Delaney has been good to me
        all summer, lending a helping, sympathizing hand at every opportunity, as
        if my wild notions and rambles and studies were his own. He is one of those
        remarkable California men who have been overflowed and denuded and remodeledby
        the excitements of the gold fields, like the Sierra landscapes by grinding
        ice, bringing the harder bosses and ridges of character into relief, \uFFFDa
        tall, lean, big-boned, big-hearted Irishman, educated for a priest in Maynooth
        College, \uFFFDlots of good in him, shining out now and then in this mountain
        light. Recognizing my love of wild places, he told me one evening that I ought
        to go through Bloody Ca\uFFFDon, for he was sure I should find it wild enough.
        He had not been there himself, he said, but had heard many of his mining friends
        speak of it as the wildest of all the Sierra passes. Of course I was glad
        to go. It lies just to the east of our camp and swoops down from the summit
        of the range to the edge of the Mono desert, making a descent of about four
        thousand feet in a distance of about four miles. It was known and traveled
        as a pass by wild animals and the Indians long before its discovery by white
        men in the gold year of 1858, as is shown by old trails which come together
        at the head of it. The name may have been suggested by the red color of the
        metamorphic slates in which the ca\uFFFDon abounds, or by the blood stains
        on the rocks from the unfortunate animals that were compelled to slide and
        shuffle over the sharp-angled boulders.\"\"\""

      description: "\"Muir stumbles upon a Native American community and describes
        their daily life. A comparison is made between the Native American life and
        that of a \"\"civilized\"\" man, they highlight the importance society places
        on a structured communityAugust 21, 1869:\"\"Just then I was startled by a
        lot of queer, hairy, muffled creatures coming shuffling, shambling, wallowing
        toward me as if they had no bones in their bodies.Had I discovered them while
        they were yet a good way off, I should have tried to avoid them. What a picture
        they made contrasted with the others I had just been admiring. When I came
        up to them, I found that they were only a band of Indians from Mono on their
        way to Yosemite for a load of acorns. They were wrapped in blankets made of
        the skins of sage-rabbits. The dirt on some of the facesseemed almost old
        enough and thick enough to have a geological significance; some were strangely
        blurred and divided into sections by seams and wrinkles that looked like cleavage
        joints, and had a worn abraded look as if they had lain exposed to the weather
        for ages. I tried to pass them without stopping, but they would n't let me;
        forming a dismal circle about me, I was closely besieged while they begged
        whiskey or tobacco, and it was hard to convince them that I had n't any. How
        glad I was to get away from the gray, grim crowd and see them vanish down
        the trail! Yet it seems sad to feel such desperate repulsion from one's fellow
        beings, however degraded. Toprefer the society of squirrels and woodchucks
        to that of our own species must surely be unnatural.\"\"\"\"The Indians I
        had met near the head of the ca\uFFFDon had camped at the foot of it the night
        before they made the ascent, and I found their fire still smoking on the side
        of a small tributary stream near Moraine Lake; and on the edge of what is
        called the Mono Desert, four or five miles from the lake, I came to a patch
        of elymus, or wild rye, growing in magnificent waving clumps six or eight
        feet high, bearing heads six to eight inches long. The crop was ripe, and
        Indian women were gathering the grain in baskets by bending down large handfuls,
        beating out the seed, and fanning it in the wind. The grains are about five
        eighths of an inch long, dark-colored and sweet. Ifancy the bread made from
        it must be as good as wheat bread. A fine squirrelish employment this wild
        grain gathering seems, and the women were evidently enjoying it, laughing
        and chattering and looking almost natural, though most Indians I have seen
        are not a whit more natural in their lives than we civilized whites. Perhaps
        if I knew them better I should like them better. The worst thing about themis
        their uncleanliness. Nothing truly wild is unclean. Down on the shore of Mono
        Lake I saw a number of their flimsy huts on the banks of streams that dash
        swiftly into that dead sea, \uFFFDmere brush tents where they lie and eat
        at their ease. Some of the men were feasting on buffalo berries, lying beneath
        the tall bushes now red with fruit. The berries are rather insipid, but they
        must needs be wholesome, sincefor days and weeks the Indians, it is said,
        eat nothing else. In the season they in like manner depend chiefly on the
        fat larv of a fly that breeds in the salt water of the lake, or on the big
        fat corrugated caterpillars of a species of silkworm that feeds on the leaves
        of the yellow pine. Occasionally a grand rabbit-drive is organized and hundreds
        are slain with clubs on the lake shore, chased and frightened into adense
        crowd by dogs, boys, girls, men and women, and rings of sage brush fire, when
        of course they are quickly killed. The skins are made into blankets. In the
        autumn the more enterprising of the hunters bring in a good many deer, and
        rarely a wild sheep from the high peaks. Antelopes used to be abundant on
        the desert at the base of the interior mountain-ranges. Sage hens, grouse,
        and squirrels help to vary their wild diet of worms; pine nuts also from the
        small interesting Pinus monophylla, and good bread and good mush are made
        from acorns and wild rye. Strange to say, they seem to like the lake larv
        best of all. Long windrows are washed up on the shore, which they gather and
        dry like grain for winter use. It is said that wars, on account of encroachments
        on each other's worm-grounds, are of common occurrence among the various tribes
        and families. Each claims a certain marked portion of the shore. The pine
        nuts are delicious, \uFFFDlarge quantities are gathered every autumn. The
        tribes of the west flank of the range trade acorns for worms and pine nuts.
        The squaws carry immense loads on their backs across the rough passes and
        down the range, making journeys of about forty or fifty miles each way.\"\"\""

      description: "\"Carlo is a St. Bernard dog given to Muir for companionship and
        assistance herding. During the journey Carlo becomes important to Muir, because
        he has been helpful herding the sheep. As the trip progresses, Muir's interactions
        with Mr. Delaney demonstrate that Muir is content with the job he had and
        is even encouraged to explore when he is not busy taking care of the flock.
        August 23, 1869:Mr. Delaney has gone to the Smith Ranch, on the Tuolumne below
        Hetch-HetchyValley, thirty-five or forty miles from here, so I'll be alone
        for a week or more, \uFFFDnot really alone, for Carlo has come back. He was
        at a camp a few miles to the northwestward. He looked sheepish and ashamed
        when I asked him where he had been and why he had gone away without leave.
        He is now trying to get me to caress him and show signs of forgiveness. A
        wondrous wise dog. A great load is offmy mind. I could not have left the mountains
        without him. He seems very glad to get back to me. August 30, 1869:\"\"Mr.
        Delaney arrived this morning. Felt not a trace of loneliness while he was
        gone. On the contrary, I never enjoyed grander company. The whole wilderness
        seems to be alive and familiar, full of humanity. The very stones seem talkative,
        sympathetic, brotherly. No wonder when we consider that we all have the same
        Father and Mother.\"\"September 6, 1869:\"\"Mr. Delaney now keeps up a solemn
        talk about the need of getting away from these high mountains, telling sad
        stories of flocks that perished in storms that broke suddenly into the midst
        of fine innocent weather like this we are now enjoying. \"\"In no case,\"\"
        said he, \"\"will I venture to stay so high and far back in the mountains
        as we now are later than the middle of this month, no matter how warm and
        sunnyit may be.\"\"September 9, 1869:\"\"Mr. Delaney has hardly had time to
        ask me how I enjoyed my trip, though he has facilitated and encouraged my
        plans all summer, and declares I'll be famous some day, a kind guess that
        seems strange and incredible to a wandering wilderness-lover with never a
        thought or dream of fame while humbly trying to trace and learn and enjoy
        Nature's lessons\"\"\""

      description: A still hardier mountaineer is the Sierra juniper (Juniperus occidentalis),
        growing mostly on domes and ridges and glacier pavements. A thickset, sturdy,
        picturesque highlander, seemingly content to live for more than a score of
        centuries on sunshine and snow; a truly wonderful fellow, dogged endurance
        expressed in every feature, lasting about as long as the granite he stands
        on. Some are nearly as broad as high. I saw one on the shore of the lake nearly
        ten feet in diameter, and many six to eight feet. The bark, cinnamon-colored,
        flakes off in long ribbon-like strips with a satiny lustre. Surely the most
        enduring of all tree mountaineers, it never seems to die a natural death,
        or even to fall after it has been killed.

        is the species that forms the timber-line, where it is so completely dwarfed
        that one may walk over the top of a bed of it as over snow-pressed chaparral.

      description: The silver firs (Abies concolor and A. magnifica) are exceedingly
        beautiful, especially the magnifica, which becomes more abundant the higher
        we go. It is of great size, one of the most notable in every way of the giant
        conifers of the Sierra. I saw specimens that measured seven feet in diameter
        and over two hundred feet in height, while the average size for what might
        be called full-grown mature trees can hardly be less than one hundred and
        eighty or two hundred feet high and five or six feet in diameter; and with
        these noble dimensions there is a symmetry and perfection of finish not to
        be seen in any other tree, hereabout at least. The branches are whorled in
        fives mostly, and stand out from the tall, straight, exquisitely tapered bole
        in level collars, each branch regularly pinnated like the fronds of ferns,
        and densely clad with leaves all around the branchlets, thus giving them a
        singularly rich and sumptuous appearance. The extreme top of the tree is a
        thick blunt shoot pointing straight to the zenith like an admonishing finger.
        The cones stand erect like casks on the upper branches. They are about six
        inches long, three in diameter, blunt, velvety, and cylindrical in form, and
        very rich and precious looking. The seeds are about three quarters of an inch
        long, dark reddish brown with brilliant iridescent purple wings, and when
        ripe, the cone falls to pieces, and the seeds thus set free at a height of
        one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet have a good send off and may fly
        considerable distances in a good breeze; and it is when a good breeze is blowing
        that most of them are shaken free to fly

      description: We have now reached a height of six thousand feet. In the forenoon
        we passed along a flat part of the dividing ridge that is planted with manzanita
        (Arctostaphylos), some specimens the largest I have seen. I measured one,
        the bole of which is four feet in diameter and only eighteen inches high from
        the ground, where it dissolves into many wide-spreading branches forming a
        broad round head about ten or twelve feet high, covered with clusters of small
        narrow-throated pink bells. The leaves are pale green, glandular, and set
        on edge by a twist of the petiole. The branches seem naked; for the chocolate-colored
        bark is very smooth and thin, and is shed off in flakes that curl when dry.
        The wood is red, close-grained, hard, and heavy. I wonder how old these curious
        tree-bushes are, probably as old as the great pines. Indians and bears and
        birds and fat grubs feast on the berries, which look like small apples, often
        rosy on one side, green on the other. The Indians are said to make a kind
        of beer or cider out of them. There are many species. This one, Arctostaphylos
        pungens, is common hereabouts. No need have they to fear the wind, so low
        they are and steadfastly rooted. Even the fires that sweep the woods seldom
        destroy them utterly, for they rise again from the root, and some of the dry
        ridges they grow on are seldom touched by fire.

        on cool slopes up toward the summit of the Pilot Peak Ridge. There is something

        of our forefathers, and through them our love for these plants has, I suppose,
        been transmitted. This species is four or five feet high, leaves soft and
        hairy, grateful to the touch, and the delicious nuts are eagerly gathered
        by Indians and squirrels. The sky as usual adorned with white noon clouds

        in diameter, the scales being open. Another specimen nineteen inches long;
        the average length of full-grown cones on trees favorably situated is nearly
        eighteen inches. On the lower edge of the belt at a height of about twenty-five
        hundred feet above the sea they are smaller, say a foot to fifteen inches
        long, and at a height of seven thousand feet or more near the upper limits
        of its growth in the Yosemite region they are about the same size.

      description: The mountain live oak, common here and a thousand feet or so higher,
        is like the live oak of Florida, not only in general appearance, foliage,
        bark, and wide-branching habit, but in its tough, knotty, unwedgebale wood.
        Standing alone with plenty of elbow room, the largest trees are about seven
        to eight feet in diameter near the ground, sixty feet high, and as wide or
        wider across the head. The leaves are small and undivided, mostly without
        teeth or wavy edging, though on young shoots some are sharply serrated, both
        kinds being found on the same tree. The cups of the medium-sized acorns are
        shallow, thick walled, and covered with a golden dust of minute hairs. Some
        of the trees have hardly any main trunk, dividing near the ground into large
        wide-spreading limbs, and these, dividing again and again, terminate in long,
        drooping, cord-like branchlets, many of which reach nearly to the ground,
        while a dense canopy of short, shining , leafy branchlets form a round head
        which looks something like a cumulus cloud when the sunshine is pouring over
        it "" (Muir, 38-39).

      description: "\"The mountain quail (Oreortyx ricta) I often meet in my walks,
        a small brown partridge with a very long, slender, ornamental crestworn jauntily
        like a feather in a boy's cap, giving it a very marked appearance. This species
        is considerably larger than the valley quail, socommon on the hot foothills.
        They seldom alight in trees, but love to wander in flocks of from five or
        six to twenty through the ceanothusand manzanita thickets and over open, dry
        meadows and rocks of the ridges where the forest is less dense or wanting,
        uttering a lowclucking sound to enable them to keep together. When disturbed
        they rise with a strong birr of wing-beats, and scatter as if explodedto a
        distance of a quarter of a mile or so. After the danger is past they call
        one another together with a louder piping note, \uFFFDNature\uFFFDsbeautiful
        mountain chickens. I have not yet found their nests. The young of this season
        are already hatched and away, \uFFFDnew broods ofhappy wanderers half as large
        as their parents. I wonder how they live through the long winters, when the
        ground is snow-covered tenfeet deep. They must go down towards the lower edge
        of the forest, like the deer, though I have not heard of them there.\""

      description: '"By the ingleside of my sheep hut,Jan. 13th, 1869, Merced Co.,
        California.Dear John and Sister Maggie:I first of all wish you a very happy
        New Year. I spent all my holidays in chasing a great band of unruly sheep
        pell mell over moor and mire. I am a gentle shepherd, an occupation which
        according to all philosophers, tends to wisdom and virtue. (Letter torn here,
        a portion missing.) I certainly have....out of the sin of silence, as scores
        of written pages can testify, but whether this is a result of following wool
        and mutton, I do not know. I thought that every letter I received would be
        the last that told of letters sent and returned, but still they come from
        all quarters, saying, ""we sent long loving epistles to San Francisco which
        came to us again."" I had a letter a few days ago from Indiana telling the
        same story. It seems that all of my friends were seized with scribble fits
        just when I was beyond the reach of post-offices.I never was so thoroughly
        hermitized as at present. Not a sheep in my flock or bird on the plains lives
        a more simple uncompounded life than I.(I) rise, eat, and drive my sheep from
        the corral to the plains in the morning, drive them to a corral at night,
        eat and lie down, and so wags my life, uneventful as the journeys of a pendulum
        in its box. But though quiet and waveless in an ordinary business interpretation,
        it lacks but little that I could wish. The care of my great mutton family
        of two thousand, keeps me employed. A grand field choir of laverocks make
        grand music every morning....on the greenest grass and in the sweetest....sends
        to the world. The Merced....song and beauty from the sublimities of Yosemite,
        and passes me at speaking distance on the south. Smooth domey flowing hills
        with the tree-fringe of the Tuolumne, bound me on the north. The lordly mountain
        wall of the Sierra meets the sky and plain on the east, and the far blue mountains
        of the Coast on the west. And now this, this, is my home. This mean twisted
        cabin is but the kennel where I sleep. The bright green fields are my home.
        Think of a glowing arch of sky resting on such a rim. Is it not a palace indeed?
        I can hardly feel myself out of door. I feel as if I were in a grand building
        whose walls radiated something that gave sensation of pleasure upon the part
        of the body exposed to the different parts of the walls. We feel the sensation
        of heat in that part of the body exposed to it, and in the same way I feel
        the sensation of the Sierra Nevadas on the part of the body exposed to them.
        If I want the Sierra Mountain feeling on my back, I stand with my back to
        them just as I would to a fire. If I want to feel the hills of the plain I
        turn to them, etc. But here I happen to remember that you, John, are a very
        practical man, and will call this nonsense. And, Maggie, you will say, ""The
        callant''s daft."" And so I will leave these subsemimetaphysical aesthetical
        vapors, and get upon good substantial orthodox ground again.I commenced the
        patriochal, time-honored work of sheep about five weeks ago at $30 per month
        for an illustrious Irishman called Smoky Jack. Smoky shows face at my shanty
        occasionally to see that I am not out of provisions. I am alone--do my own
        washing, mending, talking, and baking. I can make good bread, and eat good
        beans. I have a few maps and books which I read in the evenings or carry to
        the fields and read on some hilltop where I can see my sheep. I used to carry
        a block or two of the bread which perisheth to the field for dinner, but I
        have abandoned the practice and make breakfast span the whole distance from
        morning to night, without any stepping-stone whatever. My sheep generally
        behave pretty well and are manageable and steerable as a well-modelled ship.
        But at other times whether from lunar influences or from the devil entering
        into them as he did into the swine, I don''t know, but every fleecy rascal
        in the flock, acts like a wolf in sheep''s clothing. I do not mean to herd
        long, and I would leave the business any day like old King David if some Samuel
        would come and annoint he."'

        love[1]Near La Grange Cal. May 3d''69.Dear Mary, Your note of March 18th reached
        me a few days ago & in answer to the question it contains, I would say without
        any hesitation that to sketch residences etc. for a living is about the most
        unpractical & unhappy plan you could possibly entertain. A photographer can
        produce a picture in a few minutes that would cost you the labor of as many
        weeks & the practical taste of most people now adays would cause them to prefer
        the photograph to the pencil picture. I think that you would find it less
        difficult to earn $100 by teaching drawing than to earn $1 by selling drawings.

        and as Mother and Aunt Mary are writing I will send a few lines along too.
        The little fern arrived safely without being crushed or broken. I think it
        is very pretty. We had a nice school this last winter. Duncan Reid was our
        teacher. I study Reading Spelling Arithmetic Geography and Grammer. I never
        studied Grammer before but I like to very well. I began to write compositions
        last winter. I wrote two the subjects were Water and Trees. School will commence
        two weeks from today and I am glad because I like to go to school. I will
        gather the flowers that you spoke of and send as soon as I can. I should not
        like to be in your place because I should be so afraid of the Grizzly Bears.
        I should like lambs well enough but not sprawling all over the floor. Pa told
        me to tell you that it would be a great favor if you instead of sending a
        letter would send some of that nice weather for now there is lots of snow
        on the ground. I think you must have had a good time wandering among the rocks
        and mountains of California & wouldn\uFFFDt care if I had been with you part
        of the time. Celia is growing a big girl, she is three and a half years old
        she knows all her letters and can spell some of the little words. I hope you
        will write me again before a great while.From your affectionate niece, Anna
        G. Galloway[1]Chound Hill, April 4th, /69John MuirMy dear brotherIt is but
        a short time since I wrote to you but feel that a letter every week for the
        next three months would scarely atone for my ong silence. Just think, untill
        about two months ago, I had not written even one letter, and worse than all
        I have not received a single letter from you, since you last left home. But
        trusting it was done, alone, through neglect I will think of it no more, but
        hope to receive ere long, a good long letter and will promise to send you,
        more in future.\""

        My summer in the third heaven of the Sierra is past. I am again in the smooth
        open world of plains. I read three of your eight notes which for mount- ain
        correspondence is about as might be expected. I learned by a San Francisco
        newspaper that Dr Carr had accepted a Prof Ship in the University & Prof''
        Butler told me about a month ago that he had gone to Madison to fetch his
        Cabinet etc Therefore know that you are making a fixed home & that you will
        yet see the mts & the Joaquin plains. We were camped within a mile or two
        of the Yo Semite north wall for three weeks I used to go to the North dome
        or Jo Sem falls most every day to sketch & to listen to the waters One day
        I went down into the valley by that canon opposite HutchingsMy post office
        is Snelling as before Oct 3. 1869.'

        as the Coulterville Museum, offers visitors a glimpse of the life and times
        of early California, from the early 1800s through the boom days of the 1849
        gold rush and the post gold rush era of the late 1800s and early 20th century.  Local
        residents, many third and fourth generation descendants of the original miners,
        ranchers and shopkeepers that settled the area, established the NMCHC in 1976
        as a 501c3 charitable organization, securing the land, buildings, exhibits
        and financial support to open the Museum to the public in 1983."'

        and a new jail was constructed one block north.  At the time, the Tuolumne
        County Museum and History Collection was located in the Veterans Memorial
        Hall on Washington Street in downtown Sonora. The Board of Directors, of the
        newly formed Tuolumne County Historical Society, discussed the need for expanding
        exhibit and storage space.  At the request of the Society, the Tuolumne County
        Board of Supervisors designated the old jail as the Tuolumne County Museum
        and the Society became stewards of the Tuolumne County History Collection.
        In 1974, the Museum Board of Governors was organized to provide continuity
        on museum issues.  A Master Plan was developed for the site and the exhibits;
        Phase 1 called for construction of a new building north of the museum for
        storage and library use, Phase 2 called for rehabilitation of the museum building,
        and Phase 3 provided a plan to convert the prisoner\uFFFDs exercise yard into
        a patio for public use. Collection includes reproductions of many old photos,

        a hundred yards away from the site of the old depot. a freind first pointed
        the shop out to me in 1980. since then I have made several trips to Waterford
        to make measurements, take photos , and talk to the owner. Mark Royer is the
        blacksmith and his business license is dated February 28,1940. The Waterford
        Blacksmith Shop established in 1928. It was formerly a saloon, but Albert
        A. Royer tore it down and built the blacksmith shop using the same wood. The
        Blacksmith Shop was a thriving business until 1985 under Mark Royer, Albert\uFFFDs
        brother. Bob Riddle, Mark\uFFFDs nephew, lifted and moved the building to
        its new location outside downtown in the 1990\uFFFDs for preservation purpose.

        include two feet wide redwood siding on the facade and a protective tin roof.
        A wood addition on the side of the adobe barn was used as a stable.

        for the important role played by these commercial structures in the early
        development of mining and tourism in Mariposa County, and architecturally
        as a large and well-preserved ensemble of Mother Lode vernacular structures.
        The commercial establishments of Coulterville constituted a vital supply link
        for the early mining industry in northern Mariposa County, including placer
        mining of the 1850s, and quartz mining, which proceeded in earnest through
        the 1890s. Coulterville businesses and businessmen also played a key role
        in the opening of a tourist trade to the Yosemite Valley, the first passable
        stage route to the valley passing through Coulterville and Coulterville acting
        as an important stopping place.

        H. Kappelmann engaged in the hotel and butcher businesses in Buena Vista,
        in what is now Stanislaus County. They bought up mining claims and settler's
        claims until, by 1852, they had a tract of 3,600 acres. The 'KW' brand was
        the first in Tuolumne County in 1852. After the death of Kappelmann, Willms
        carried on alone, and the ranch has been owned by the Willms family ever since.

        the department store until 1969. In addition, between 1906 and 1923 the Emporium
        served as a telephone station for calls through the county.

        life as a store but was purchased in 1873 by the Masons for Lodge Hall No.
        98. It played a critical role in social life of its memebers. The building
        continues today as a lodge hall but the period of significance ends in 1930
        when the fraternal organization played less of a role in the daily lives of
